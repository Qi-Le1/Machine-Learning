This homework is collaborating with Yuming Hu (hu000379@umn.edu). We have discussed the way to approach the adaboost algorithm.We write our own solution individually.

Question1 would run about 4 minutes.

For Q2 part2, the error would be different for each run.

For Question 3, since I randomly choose the centroids, the quality of the segmented plot would fluctuate greatly.
